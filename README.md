# DiscordBot
Discord Bot for miscellaneous tasks. Starting with music.

Powershell Script for quick launch with virtual environment and self-hosting.
This bot is more of an attempt on learning asynchronous functions. There are plenty of way better music bots to reference from.

If I were to contribute something new to the giant masses of discord bots, it would be:
- Ability to stream youtube videos instead of downloading it (As sound. Video streaming would be a cool challenge too)
---I heard the Discord JavaScript bots can do this. Not sure why Python is limited. Maybe due to how Discord.py library is written?
In any case, Discord.py's creator has ceased development so this might be outdated. If Discord decides to change their API drastically,
many python Discord bots would cease to exist. Due to the ambiguous state of future development and the availability of many other bots
out there that have all the functionalities you really need, I won't be developing this much if at all.
- Ability to play SoundCloud and Spotify links (Some music bots handle this and that's neat)

-Future plan:
I could look into developing Discord bots in other languages. Java and JavaScript are viable and updating.
